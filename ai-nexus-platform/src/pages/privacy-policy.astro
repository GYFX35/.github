  <h1>Privacy Policy for {platformName}</h1>
  <p><em>Effective Date: {effectiveDate}</em></p>

  <p>Welcome to {platformName} ("us", "we", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website [Your Website URL - Placeholder] (the "Service"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the site.</p>
  <p><strong>This is a placeholder document and should be reviewed and customized by a legal professional.</strong></p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>For the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of {platformName}, we aim to collect minimal information from our users.</p>

  <h3>a) Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Usage Data)</h3>
  <p>Like most website operators, we may collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use the Service and to maintain and improve the Service. This data is typically collected through our web hosting provider's analytics (e.g., Netlify Analytics, Vercel Analytics) or a simple client-side analytics tool (if implemented).</p>

  <h3>b) Information from Developer Submissions</h3>
  <p>If you are a game developer and you submit your game for curation consideration via our stated submission process (e.g., email or a linked third-party form), we will collect the information you voluntarily provide. This may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name and/or studio name</li>
    <li>Your contact email address</li>
    <li>Information about your game (title, description, links, AI features, development status)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is used solely for the purpose of evaluating your game for potential inclusion on the {platformName} platform and communicating with you regarding your submission.</p>

  <h3>c) Cookies</h3>
  <p>For the MVP, {platformName} aims to use minimal or no cookies directly. However, our hosting provider or any embedded third-party services (like a submission form or analytics) might use cookies. A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information we collect in the following ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To operate and maintain our Service.</li>
    <li>To improve our Service and user experience (based on aggregated, anonymized usage data).</li>
    <li>To process and evaluate game submissions from developers.</li>
    <li>To communicate with developers regarding their submissions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Disclosure Of Your Information</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information (such as developer contact details) to outside parties unless we provide users with advance notice or are required by law.</p>
  <p>This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you (e.g., email providers, hosting providers), so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.</p>
  <p>Non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses (e.g., aggregated site traffic statistics).</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect your information. Our website is served over HTTPS. Information submitted by developers is stored in our internal systems with appropriate access controls. However, no electronic transmission over the internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to us.</p>

  <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or 16 in certain jurisdictions like the EEA). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under this age. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>
  <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
