# AR/VR Fictional Cycling Game

## Project Overview

This project is a fictional cycling game designed to be playable in standard (PC/console), Augmented Reality (AR), and Virtual Reality (VR) modes. The game simulates a cycling experience with procedurally generated tracks and aims to provide an immersive experience across different platforms.

## Current Status

This codebase represents an initial scaffolding of the game's architecture. It includes placeholder scripts for core game logic, AR/VR integration, UI management, asset and sound management, and basic unit tests.

**Note:** This is not a runnable game. It is a set of C# scripts that would require a game engine (like Unity or Unreal Engine) and appropriate SDKs (ARCore, ARKit, SteamVR, Oculus SDK, etc.) to be fully implemented and functional.

## Core Components

The game is structured around several key manager scripts located in `ARVRGame/Assets/Scripts/`:

*   **`GameManager.cs`**: The central coordinator of the game. It manages game state (MainMenu, Playing, Paused, GameOver), game mode (Standard, AR, VR), and interactions between other managers.
*   **`CyclingPhysics.cs`**: Handles the simulation of bicycle movement, including acceleration, braking, and turning.
*   **`TrackGenerator.cs`**: Responsible for creating or loading cycling tracks. Currently, it can generate a simple random track.
*   **`ARIntegration.cs`**: Placeholder for AR-specific functionalities (e.g., plane detection, AR camera setup). Would integrate with AR SDKs.
*   **`VRIntegration.cs`**: Placeholder for VR-specific functionalities (e.g., head tracking, VR controller input, VR camera setup). Would integrate with VR SDKs.
*   **`UIManager.cs`**: Manages the user interface, including menus (main, settings, pause, game over) and the in-game HUD. It's designed to adapt UI for different game modes.
*   **`AssetManager.cs`**: Handles loading and providing access to game assets like 3D models, textures, and audio files.
*   **`SoundManager.cs`**: Manages playback of sound effects and background music, utilizing assets loaded by the `AssetManager`.

## Directory Structure

*   `ARVRGame/`: Root directory for the game project.
    *   `Assets/`: Contains all game assets.
        *   `Audio/`: Placeholder for audio files (SFX, music).
        *   `Models/`: Placeholder for 3D models.
        *   `Scripts/`: Contains all C# scripts.
            *   `Tests/`: Contains placeholder unit test scripts.
        *   `Textures/`: Placeholder for texture files.
    *   `Documentation/`: Contains project documentation (like this README).
    *   `Packages/`: Placeholder for game engine package configurations.
    *   `ProjectSettings/`: Placeholder for game engine project settings.
    *   `UserSettings/`: Placeholder for game engine user-specific settings.

## How to Use (Conceptual)

1.  **Set up a Game Engine:** Import these scripts into a C# compatible game engine (e.g., Unity).
2.  **Install SDKs:** For AR/VR functionality, install relevant SDKs (ARCore/ARKit for AR, Oculus/SteamVR for VR).
3.  **Link Scripts to Game Objects:** In the game engine, create GameObjects and attach these scripts to them. For example, an empty GameObject could run `GameManager`.
4.  **Develop Assets:** Create or import 3D models for the bicycle, environment, textures, and audio clips. Place them in the respective `Assets` subfolders. Update `AssetManager.cs` to load these actual assets.
5.  **Implement AR/VR Specifics:** Fill in the placeholder logic in `ARIntegration.cs` and `VRIntegration.cs` using the chosen SDKs. This includes camera setup, input handling, and environment interaction.
6.  **Build UI:** Design and implement the UI elements (menus, HUD) using the game engine's UI system. Connect UI events (button clicks) to the methods in `UIManager.cs`.
7.  **Refine Physics and Gameplay:** Adjust parameters in `CyclingPhysics.cs` and expand `TrackGenerator.cs` for more varied and interesting tracks.
8.  **Testing:** Utilize the engine's test runner (if available) or expand the provided test scripts to thoroughly test game logic.

## Future Development Ideas

*   **Advanced Track Generation:** Implement more sophisticated procedural generation algorithms for tracks, including varied terrain, obstacles, and scenery.
*   **Power-ups and Collectibles:** Add items that players can collect on the track for temporary boosts or points.
*   **Opponent AI:** Introduce AI-controlled cyclists for competitive gameplay.
*   **Multiplayer Mode:** Allow players to race against each other online.
*   **Detailed Graphics and Environments:** Create rich visual environments that change based on the track or game mode.
*   **Haptic Feedback:** Integrate haptic feedback for AR/VR controllers or compatible cycling hardware.
*   **User Profiles and Progression:** Allow users to create profiles, save progress, and unlock achievements.

## Contribution

This is a conceptual project. For actual development, one would typically follow standard game development practices, including version control (e.g., Git), task management, and iterative development cycles.
